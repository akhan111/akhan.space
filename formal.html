        <h2>Acrylic and Semen on Canvas<br>
            40" x 30", 2019</h2>
        <p>Inspired both by Caravaggio and Dalí, this piece equates Narcissus' individual self-infatuation and ensuing self-destruction with that of humanity. However, unlike Caravaggio's symbolic continuous composition, the "reflection" depicted here is broken ‒ a tragic end to the cycle and a warning as we enter the environmental point of no return. The painting is accompanied by the short story "The Myth of Man: Narcissus Retold."</p>

        <p>In the early 1900s, the Bolsheviks funded attempts to disprove creationism (and thus Christianity) in the name of communism: the Soviet scientist Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov’s experimentation involving the hybridization of humans with other apes was reportedly on track to success before his arrest alongside political disturbance.</p>

        <h2>Acrylic on Canvas<br>
            36" x 48", 2017</h2>
        <p>“So God created man in His own image.” This piece relies on its own controversy to convey the message. Many cannot accept the glorification of another species to such a high degree. Despite chimpanzees sharing nearly 99% of our DNA, it is seen as offensive or even sacrilegious to place them in a holy context. However, this painting is not meant to denounce the status of religion, but rather to elevate the status of animals.</p>

        <h2>Acrylic on Canvas<br>
            30" x 40", 2017</h2>
        <p>The desire that is so private and taboo in modern society links us to the other members of the animal kingdom. Many humans forget that sex is a necessary component of reproduction and evolution, and instead try desperately to mask and hide their natural needs.</p>

        <h2>Acrylic on Canvas<br>
            36" x 48", 2017</h2>
        <p>Shaving is a necessary ritual to psychologically isolate us from our ape ancestry. Humans grow hair, though less of it, in many of the same places that other apes grow hair ‒ and the underlying similarities are striking. This piece was inspired by Mongo, a chimpanzee at Twycross Zoo that suffered from alopecia.</p>

        <p>Love him or hate him, one thing is for sure: Trump speaks and acts without restraint. The quality of self-restraint separates us from other species, and, by minimizing this, Trump makes it easier for some to see him as a member of Homonidae (as we all are) rather than as an individual of a greater society. Furthermore, the work investigates how a portrait can blur boundaries across species while still retaining recognizable features of the individual depicted.</p>

        <h2>Acrylic on Canvas<br>
            42" x 38", 2017</h2>
        <p>What better way to display our simian musculature than through the age-old ritual of pole dancing? On a heavier note, this piece was inspired by the horrific discovery of an orangutan, named Pony, being exploited as a sex slave in Borneo.</p>

        <p>An orangutan smoking a cigar is ridiculous. So why, then, does this figure seem so familiar? This piece is inspired by the power and authority even another species can possess, but that humans generally only associate with our own kind. This painting is on (accidental) display at the High School for Performing and Visual Arts in Houston ‒ if you're reading this Mr. Tellez, please give it back!</p>

        <p class="casual hidden">The scenery is drawn from a photo of an orangutan spearfishing ‒ a learned behavior for obtaining food. This is not so different from children I observed climbing trees for ripe mangos in Honduras. In looking at similar behaviors across species, the physical likenesses in both motion and musculature also present themselves more clearly.</p>

        <p class="casual hidden">Nothing is more tragic than the look of silent desperation in someone's eyes. This can be found in humans, as well as in the creatures that truly can't voice their despair. I saw that look when gazing into this chimpanzee’s concrete cell at the Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens. Zoos serve important roles in society, but they must be held to higher standards if humanity is to continue its trajectory of ethical progress.</p>

        <p>Humans have domesticated wildlife for millennia. Yuval Noah Harari, in his book <i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i>, argues that in the process, we have been domesticated as well. In evolutionary terms, few species are as successful as the domestic ones, which are constantly being provided for through human labor.</p>

        <p>Countless portraits have been painted of humans as people. This self-portrait instead portrays the human as an animal. This is approached by treating the skin as another artist may treat a coat of fur, by capturing a blank, deer-in-headlights gaze, and by placing the figure in a natural environment devoid of human construction.</p>
